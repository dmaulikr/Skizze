Skizze

This is a version of the popular kids Etcha-A-Sketch game. I wrote this app originally for sale in the App Store, where it eventually ended up. However, I thought the game was old enough to be out of copyright. I was wrong and they (The Ohio Art Company and Freeze Tag) told me so and I pulled it.  It is important to note that this is still the case. You cannot, you must not, try to release this app commercially or they will, quite rightly, try to sue you. This is code that has just sat idle on my computer and so it might as well get out there and be of use to people learning how to program for iOS but someone else owns the intellectual property rights.
